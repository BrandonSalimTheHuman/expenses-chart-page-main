## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
- See the current day's bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: See dynamically generated bars based on the data provided in the local JSON file

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Throughout designing the divs, things still made sense and I think I generally understood the html file and css file, but the chart part was completely new to me.

From this format, I learnt how to input data, set the colors and opacity of bar graphs, and show it.



### Continued development

One main point that I hope to be better with is to break down problems into logical steps. Upon seeing the end result, I initially had no idea how to convert the starting website into the result, but I hope to be able to lay out steps and think it through better in the future
